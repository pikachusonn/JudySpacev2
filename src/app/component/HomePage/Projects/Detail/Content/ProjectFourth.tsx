        During the launch of Saymee, a new SIM card product by Mobifone, I
        worked as part of the marketing team at OSP Group to execute an
        integrated marketing and sales campaign across multiple digital
        platforms. Our strategy spanned both{" "}
        <span className="font-bold text-tertiary/80">brand-building</span> and
        <span className="font-bold text-tertiary/80">sales conversion</span>,
        covering social media, Shopee, and TikTok Shop.

          I played a role in{" "}
          <span className="font-bold text-tertiary/80">content creation</span>{" "}
          for the official Saymee fanpage, producing engaging and
          product-focused social media materials aimed at young, tech-savvy
          audiences. Simultaneously, I developed and managed content for a
          network of satellite TikTok channels, designed to organically drive
          brand awareness and lead potential customers toward the product
          purchase funnel. <br />

              - Writing copy and planning visuals tailored to each platformâ€™s

          This project strengthened my ability to create sales-driven content,
          especially in telecommunications and e-commerce ecosystems, and to
          synchronize efforts across multiple channels to drive both visibility
          and transactions for a new product launch.
